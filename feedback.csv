A SVM-based classification model is proposed to work as a prediction function. This function takes Wi-Fi parameters both for target AP and nearby interference APs as input, and output is categorized Wi-Fi throughput, good, medium, poor or very poor. Di errant SVM kernel functions conducted to evaluate the proposed model and results show that classification accuracy can be up to 0.88. It demonstrates that Wi-Fi throughput could be classified using a simple measurement way and limited Wi-Fi physical parameters. As a prediction function, an SVM-based classification model is suggested.
